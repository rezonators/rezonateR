<h1 id="rezonater">rezonateR</h1>
<p>rezonateR (pronounced "resonate R") uses R (statistics software) to analyze and visualize data about resonance in natural language. The data that rezonateR takes as input are those created by the companion tool <a href="https://github.com/johnwdubois/rezonator">Rezonator</a>.   <br />
In addition, rezonateR can provide some pre-processing of natural language data to prepare them for importing into Rezonator.   </p>
<p>Resonance represents the activation of affinities across utterances in natural language. Resonance plays a key part in creating links between parallel structures, thereby inviting the perception of parallel meanings. Resonance is a key factor in the creation of coherence in dialogue, and the organization of engagement between co-participants in conversation.      </p>
