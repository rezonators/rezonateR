## Getting started

In this tutorial, we will learn about how time and sequence is handled in rezonateR. More features relating to more fine-grained time may be available later, so watch this space!

This file will use the file saved at the end of `vignette("time_seq")`. As always, you don't have to have read that tutorial beforehand, though it may be helpful if you are new to rezonateR.

```{r}
library(rezonateR)
path = system.file("extdata", "rez007_edit1.Rdata", package = "rezonateR", mustWork = T)
rez007 = rez_load(path)
```
