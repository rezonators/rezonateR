Hello! If you're reading this tutorial, you're probably wondering how exactly RezonateR works, how to import data into RezonateR and how to understand how the data is then structured internally. If this desribes your situation, then this tutorial is for you!

You may or may not have read the introduction (vignette("overview")) that gives an overview to RezonateR, and it's fine either way - everything overed in that introduction that you'll need will be repeated here, in greater detail. The only exception is if you have not installed rezonateR at all - in that case, please do install it using the instructions from that tutorial first!

In this tutorial, we will first meet the file that we need to import, along with a brief introduction on how Rezonator's JSON format, .rez files, are structured. Then we'll import the file into Rezonator, and the

## Meet our file!

To begin with, in this tutorial we will be using a simple Rezonator file. This file contains a minimal amount of annotation - just enough to explain the basic workings of RezonateR without being bogged down in long loading times that would result from a more extensively annotated files. The file is based on the text *A Tree's Life*, a conversation between two sisters. The first part of the file, which deals with the topic of one of the sisters' roommates, has been annotated for coreference (trails), resonance, as well as argument structure (through trees). There are also largely arbitrary stacks drawn throughout the file.

### Node maps: The secret life of Rezonator files

The .rez files produced by Rezonator are visualised through the Rezonator interface, but they lead a secret double life! Internally, they are represented by a structure called a node map. All objects inside .rez files are represented as nodes, which store information in the form of text, numbers and pointers to other nodes.

To get an idea of what the node map looks like, let's load a .rez file. (You will never need to do this directly when working in rezonateR, as the import function will handle it for you; this is for demonstration purposes only.) We'll extract the node map from the .rez file after importing it into R, and then store it in the variable `rez007_nm`.

```{r}
path = system.file("extdata", "sbc007.rez", package = "rezonateR", mustWork = T)

library(rjson)
getwd()
rez007_json = rjson::fromJSON(file = path)
rez007_nm = rez007_json[["ROOT"]][[1]][["nodeMap"]]
```

Let's zero on to a single node. The simplest type of node is a token, or a 'word' (this may be a morpheme or some other unit depending on the language and data you're working with.). Inside the Rezonator interface, tokens are the basic unit that you may interact with. Let's try the word 'midnight'. The word 'midnight' that you see on the screen has an ID of `28A862601A235`, and that's the key we access it from the node map by. Let's go ahead and examine some of the information embeddded inside the node:

```{r}
midnight = rez007_nm[["28A862601A235"]]
print(paste0("type: ", midnight$type))
print(paste0("docTokenSeq: ", midnight$docTokenSeq))
print(paste0("unit: ", midnight$unit))
print(paste0("place: ", midnight$place))
print(paste0("inEntryList: ", midnight$inEntryList))
print(paste0("inChainsList: ", midnight$inChainsList))
print(paste0("inChunkList: ", midnight$inChunkList))
print("tagMap:")
print(sapply(midnight$tagMap, c))
```
The `type` value indicates that we're looking at a token. `docTokenSeq` indicates the position of the word within the document. `unit` is a pointer to the node that contains the token's unit. `place` gives the position of the token within the unit.

The next three are lists of pointers to larger structures that may contain the token. (These 'lists' in .rez files are represented by vectors, not lists, in R.) `inEntryList`, `inChainsList` and `inChunkList` give the entries, chains and chunks in which 'midnight' are found. We will discuss entries in the next section. A chain is either a Track chain, i.e. trail, or a Rez chain, i.e. a resonance. In this case, 'midnight' was put in a trail, albeit one that contains only itself (i.e. it is a singleton), which is why you see a coloured box around the word, but no links emanating from it. So we do see a pointer to the track chain. It does not belong to any chunks, i.e. the larger rectangles typically consisting of multiple words.

The `tagMap` of a specific node includes the tags that were given when the raw file was first imported into Rezonator, as well as tags that were created by Rezonator or manually added in Rezonator. These tags were all given during import; we will see examples of these later.

### Tokens and units
An entry is a leftover structure in Rezonator that currently serves no real purpose, except as the intermediate layer between units and tokens. As a general rule, entries correspond one-to-one with tokens. This is a technicality that you will occasionally need to know when working in RezonateR.

Basically, a unit only contains pointers to the entries that consists of it, in the attribute `entryList`. To look up individual tokens from a unit, then, you will have to go to individual entries' nodes to look up the corresponding token. For example, here is the entryList of the unit 2D1B3667B6110:

```{r}
print("entryList of unit 2D1B3667B6110:")
print(rez007_nm[["2D1B3667B6110"]][["entryList"]])
```

To look up the first token in this unit, the word 'if', you need to look at the token value of the associated entry:

```{r}
print("token corresponding to entry 24796648BFF31:")
rez007_nm[["24796648BFF31"]][["token"]]
```

Let's now verify that this token is indeed the word 'if':

```{r}
print("token corresponding to token A27E39A69272:")
rez007_nm[["A27E39A69272"]]$tagMap$text
```

### Chunks
Chunks are the large rectangular boxes that typically span more than one token. A chunk is automatically created whenever you add a track or rez entry that spans more than one token, but not when you add a single-token track or rez entry. So, for example, *midnight* was not put inside a chunk, but *the purpose of getting up in the morning* was put in a chunk the moment it became part of a track chain.

There are also chunks that do not belong to any chains, sometimes called *blank chunks*. In this document, blank chunks are used to mark verbal complexes in English, including verbs and auxiliaries, as well as any intervening adverbs. When a nominal intervenes between the auxiliary and the verb, the auxiliary is excluded from the verb chunk.

The word *stay* on line 3 belongs to a blank chunk and a chunk in a track chain. Let's look at those two chunks. The ID for the token *stay* is 1A0742C9033E5:

```{r}
print("Chunks that contain 1A0742C9033E5:")
rez007_nm[["1A0742C9033E5"]]$inChunkList
```

So the two chunks that contain *stay* are 35E3E0AB6803A ans 15B9BB5D5086C. 35E3E0AB6803A is the larger chunk that belongs to a chain (note that the individual token *stay* 1A0742C9033E5 does *not* belong in the chain):

```{r} 
print("Chains that contain 35E3E0AB6803A:")
rez007_nm[["35E3E0AB6803A"]]$inChainsList
print("Chains that contain 1A0742C9033E5:")
rez007_nm[["1A0742C9033E5"]]$inChainsList
```
A manually added field in this file, `chunkType`, specifies the type of chunk that a certain chunk is. The field is blank for mentions in track chains, but filled for verbs:

```{r} 
print("chunkType of 35E3E0AB6803A:")
rez007_nm[["35E3E0AB6803A"]]$tagMap$chunkType
print("chunkType of 15B9BB5D5086C:")
rez007_nm[["15B9BB5D5086C"]]$tagMap$chunkType
```
This point will be important later on when we import, as it will be used to separate chunks into layers.

### Entries, links and chains
Rezonator currently has three data types that are termed 'chains'. Each of them have specific names for their entries. They are:
* A chain of track objects (i.e. mentions) is called a *trail* - i.e. a coreference chain containing mentions
* A chain of rez objects is a *resonances* - a rez object is a specific instance of a word that is resonated somewhere else in the document, and a resonance is a collection of resonating tokens
* A chain of cards is a *stack*.

The first two types of entries correspond to words and chunks, and the third type of entries correspond to units.

Let's look at the track 1BF2260B4AB78, which corresponds to the chunk *Stay up late* 35E3E0AB6803A that we have seen before:

```{r}
rez007_nm[["1BF2260B4AB78"]]$chain
rez007_nm[["1BF2260B4AB78"]]$token
rez007_nm[["1BF2260B4AB78"]]$goalLinkList
```
*Stay up late* belongs to the chain, and corresponds to the 'token' (actually chunk - this is a quirk of the .rez format that will be important to remember when working in rezonateR) 35E3E0AB6803A. `goalLinkList` is a list of links that starts from this entry. Links live in a world of their own and are not particularly important for working in RezonateR, so we can safely ignore them for now.

To find out the member entries that a chain contains, you can look at its `setIDList`.

```{r}
rez007_nm[["2A01379C5D049"]]$setIDList
```
Entries and chains, like tokens (and units), have `tagMap`s, and these generally correspond to tags generated or manually added in Rezonator. Here's the tagMap of the track and trail we've seen. The track contains the tags `gapWords` (number of words from the previous track) and `gapUnits` (number of units from the previous track), as well as counts for the number of tokens and characters inside the track. The tag `chainSize` indicates the number of entries inside the chain. These are all automatically generated by Rezonator and will be covered in more detail when discussing coreference.

```{r}
sapply(rez007_nm[["1BF2260B4AB78"]]$tagMap, c)
sapply(rez007_nm[["2A01379C5D049"]]$tagMap, c)
```
### The tree map
Information related to trees reside in a sub-map of their own, separate from their . There are three types of objects inside the tree map: `treeEntry`, `treeLink` and `tree`. 

A treeEntry is a 'leaf' of a tree. It may contain one or multiple 'leaves', 

## Importing our file
Let's now actually import the file into RezonateR! Obviously our first step is to import the file:

```{r}
library(rezonateR)
```


The import function is `importRez`. When importing, there are two important settings you will need to set. We will store the values of these settings in variables before importing.

The first one is `layerRegex`:

```{r}
layerRegex = list(chunk = list(field = "chunkType",
                               regex = c("verb"),
                               names = c("verb", "refexpr")))
```

`layerRegex` allows you to separate chunks, tracks, rezes and trees as well as associated objects such as trails and treeEntries into layers. (At the moment, it is not technically possible for there to be meaningful stack layers, so this has not yet been implemented for stacks.) Each layer will receive a separate data frame.

In this file, we have two types of chunks: verbs and (largely) referential expressions. Verbs are annotated with the `chunkType` value 'verb', and referential expressions are unannotated. In order to tell this to rezonateR, we need to set layerRegex. We need to pass a list to layerRegex. The keys to this list must be in the list 'chunk', 'track', 'rez', 'tree'; you can't use other keywords (such as 'trail').

Each of these entries is another list with three values: `field`, `regex` and `names`. The field `field` specifies the name of the field that will determine layer status. The field `regex` specifies a list of regular expressions which, if matched, will put an object in a certain layer. The field `names` specifies the layer names; when it has one more item than the regex list (in this case the extra item is `"refexpr"`), then that layer is for items that do not match any of the regexes.

**If you do not assign layers to any of chunk, track, rez and tree, everything will be placed in a layer called `default`.*** In our case, track, rez and tree (and their related object) are all put in a layer called `default`. We will see how this works later on.

The other setting is `concatFields`:

```{r}
concatFields = c("text", "transcript")
```

When we are just looking at nodeMaps, we often feel lost because many nodes do not have any semblance of text on them. In order to fix this, we can concatenate the text or transript fields of the tokens associated with each node. These fields must be specified as a vector passed to `concatFields`.

Here is the import function, using the settings from above. If you're following on, do note that this takes long! The tree-related steps should, in particular, take extra time to process.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
rez007 = importRez(path,
                   layerRegex = layerRegex,
                   concatFields = concatFields)
```

The variable `rez007` belongs to the class `rezrObj`. A `rezrObj` consists of two components: a `nodeMap` and a bunch of `rezrDF`s. Let's look at the `nodeMap` object first.

### Meeting our nodeMap again
If you felt a bit lost when we were exploring .rez files before, here's some good news: `nodeMap`s in RezonateR are slightly easier to navigate than the node map in .rez files (phew)! The only major difference is that in rezonateR `nodeMap`s, every item type belongs to its own list. So the nodes in `rez007` nodeMap are organised into these categories:

```{r}
names(rez007$nodeMap)
```
To save the imported object (something you will definitely want to do - nobody wants to import again!), use the function rez_save(). To load it again, use the function rez_load(). Both 

```{r}
savePath = "rez007.Rdata"
rez_save(rez007, savePath)
myRez = rez_load(savePath)
```
